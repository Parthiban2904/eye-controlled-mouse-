# eye-controlled-mouse-
This project going to be an eye-controlled mouse works using MediaPipe. The camera captures the userâ€™s face, and MediaPipe FaceMesh detects eye landmarks. Eye movements are mapped to cursor position, while blinks trigger clicks. PyAutoGUI then controls the cursor and displays the output on the screen.
